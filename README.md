My first Game Jam. 3 days, 12 teams of 6 people and 1 theme : "Linked for better or for worse"
Me and my team won the jury's price with this 2 player 3d Platformer.
We control one character with KBM and the other with a ps5 controller putting aside the tensions between console and PC ðŸ˜…
The 2 player need to help each other to solve some puzzles and advance on the levels.
Items can get picked up to enable some special abilities that will be required to solve other puzzles.
Combining abilities is the only way to reach the end.
